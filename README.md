# FeedMe

Feedme is a randomized restaurant selector. It utilizes two APIs, Zomato and Uncaged, to search either an entered location or your current geolocation. This app was built to practice and familiarize myself with receiving third party data.

A hosted demo of this app can be found here: https://feedme-813b6.web.app/
